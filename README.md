# VT's Gamepad Haptics

## Binding the controllers:
In "ContactBinds.json" you will find a bunch of keys accompanied by null. Replace null with the type of controller you want to bind to that haptic. 

### Controller names are the following:
- PS4 Controller
- Nintendo Switch Joy-Con (L)
- Nintendo Switch Joy-Con (R)
- Nintendo Switch Joy-Con (L/R)
- Xbox One S Controller
- Nintendo Switch Pro Controller
- Xbox 360 Controller
- Sony Interactive Entertainment Wireless Controller
- Controller (XBOX 360 For Windows)
- Wireless Controller

Note: Only the first 5 items of the list were tested. Any controller that is compatable with pygame and has a vibration motor should work just as well.
